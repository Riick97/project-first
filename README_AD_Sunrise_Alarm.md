|6-10 s|Speed ramp (0.2× → 1×) wide shot: room gradually brightens, user yawns & smiles before alarm tone.| **“No jarring beeps. Just light + nature.”** |“Neovibe starts brightening 30 min before your alarm.”|Add faint birds-chirping layer under the beat |

|13-17 s|UGC testimonial clip (split-screen duet style) – happy user giving thumbs-up while doing morning stretch.|Caption bottom: **“5⭐ from 1,200+ heavy sleepers”** |Real voice (sounds candid): “I wake up BEFORE the sound—actually refreshed.”|Beat dips volume, testimonial audio front-and-center |

### Creator Notes
- **Hook hard:** The first 1-2 seconds must scream relatability—wake-up rage face + obnoxious alarm.
- **Film in vertical (9 × 16)**, natural lighting when possible; exaggerate sunrise glow with warm LUT.
- Keep cuts < 1.5 s after the 6-second mark—TikTok favors rapid pacing.
- Overlay **auto-captions**; many viewers watch muted.
- Use text styles that match current trends: bold condensed font, colored shadow, slight bounce animation.
- End-card should stick on screen for a full beat so the CTA is tappable.
