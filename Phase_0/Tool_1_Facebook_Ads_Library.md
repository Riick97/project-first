Good question — the **Facebook Ads Library** is a really useful (and free) tool for spotting trending products, competitor strategies, and even gauging demand before you commit to selling something. Here’s a practical way to use it step by step:

---

## 🔎 Step 1: Go to the Facebook Ads Library

* Open [https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/](https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/)
* Select your country (or “All” if you want a wider search).
* Choose “All Ads” instead of issues/elections.

---

## 🛒 Step 2: Search for Keywords

* Type in broad **product categories** you’re interested in, like:

  * “LED lights”
  * “Portable blender”
  * “Smartwatch”
  * “Pet toy”
* This shows all active ads that mention those keywords in text, video, or product descriptions.

---

## 📈 Step 3: Filter & Identify Winners

Look for signals that a product is working:

* **Running for a long time** → if an ad has been active for weeks or months, it’s likely profitable.
* **Multiple variations** → if you see many different creatives for the same product/brand, they’re testing at scale.
* **Engagement** (likes, comments, shares on the ad) → higher engagement often signals consumer interest.

---

## 🎥 Step 4: Analyze the Creatives

* What angles are they using? (Problem-solving, lifestyle, emotional appeal, humor?)
* What formats? (Short TikTok-style videos, testimonials, before/after clips, UGC?)
* Do they highlight **benefits over features**?
  Take notes — you’ll use these insights when making your own ads.

---

## 🧭 Step 5: Reverse-Engineer Competitors

* Click on the advertiser’s name → you’ll see all ads they’re running.
* This helps you understand if they’re **scaling one winning product** or testing many.
* You can also check their **landing page** by clicking through the ad. Study product pages, offers, upsells, etc.

---

## 🚀 Step 6: Validate Product Potential

Combine Ads Library data with other checks:

* **Google Trends** → see if search demand is rising.
* **TikTok / Instagram Reels** → check if people are organically posting about it.
* **AliExpress / Amazon reviews** → confirm it’s not oversaturated and has good supplier options.

---

👉 Pro tip: Start broad with categories (e.g., “home gadgets”), then niche down when you see products repeated by multiple advertisers — those often indicate **hot demand**.

Do you want me to make a **step-by-step example search** (e.g., “LED projector”) and break down how to spot if it’s a winning product inside Ads Library?
