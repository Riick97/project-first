Perfect — let’s do the same with **Google Trends** to spot a product. I’ll walk you through an example search so you can see how to tell if something has demand.

---

## 🔎 Step 1: Go to Google Trends

* Open [https://trends.google.com](https://trends.google.com)
* Set the **region** (Worldwide or your target market).
* Set the **timeframe** — usually:

  * 12 months → see seasonality
  * 5 years → see long-term trend

---

## 🛒 Step 2: Search a Product Idea

Example: **“LED projector”**

* You’ll get a graph showing how interest has changed over time.
* Rising trend → demand is growing.
* Flat/declining → might be oversaturated or out of style.

---

## 📈 Step 3: Compare Products

You can compare up to 5 keywords. For example:

* “LED projector” vs “star projector” vs “galaxy light”

This shows which exact keyword has more consistent demand — so you know which version of the product is hotter.

---

## 🌍 Step 4: Check Regional Demand

Scroll down → “Interest by subregion”

* This tells you which countries (or even cities) search the most.
* If you’re targeting US ads but the biggest demand is in Germany, that’s good to know.

---

## 🧩 Step 5: Find Related Topics & Queries

At the bottom:

* **Rising queries** → new, fast-growing search terms (these often signal **new product trends**).
* Example: If you search “star projector,” a rising query might be “galaxy night light for kids” → this shows a **niche angle** to market it.

---

✅ Quick Example with “Portable Blender”:

* Interest is high every summer → seasonal product.
* Related queries: “USB blender,” “smoothie blender for travel” → people care about portability and health lifestyle angles.

---

👉 Pro tip: A **steady or rising upward curve** + **rising related queries** = product worth testing. A **spiky one-hit wonder curve** = risky unless you catch it early.

Do you want me to pick **a product category from Neovibe (smart gadgets, lighting, accessories)** and run a real Google Trends breakdown for you, so you see exactly how to interpret it?
