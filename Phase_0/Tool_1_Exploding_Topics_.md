Alright, let’s do a **hands-on walkthrough with Exploding Topics** so you can see how to use it in the product-finding phase. 🚀

## 🔎 Step 1: Go to Exploding Topics

* Visit [https://explodingtopics.com](https://explodingtopics.com).
* You can use the free version or Pro for deeper data.

---

## 🛒 Step 2: Choose a Category

* On the site, select categories like:

  * **Consumer Products** (great for gadgets, accessories)
  * **Design** (home aesthetics, lighting)
  * **Fitness** (wearables, recovery tools)
  * **Beauty** (skincare devices, IPL removers)
* This helps filter to your niche.

---

## 📈 Step 3: Look at Rising Topics

Each “topic card” shows:

* 📊 A growth chart → interest over the last few years
* 🔥 A label → “Exploding,” “Regular,” or “Peaked”
* 📝 A short description

You want **Exploding** or **Regular (still climbing)**, not “Peaked.”

## 🎯 Example: Searching for Smart Lighting

* Category: **Design / Consumer Products**
* Topics might include:

  * **“Galaxy Projector”** → strong growth, aligns with Neovibe’s focus.
  * **“LED Strip Lights”** → still trending, especially in gaming setups.
  * **“Nanoleaf”** (brand-driven, but signals demand for modular smart lighting).

This tells you:
👉 People are actively searching for immersive, customizable lighting setups.

---

## 🧭 Step 4: Expand the Research

Once you spot a promising topic:

* Plug it into **Google Trends** → confirm demand over time.
* Check **TikTok Creative Center** → see if ads/organic content are booming.
* Search in **Facebook Ads Library** → are dropshippers scaling it?
* Look up **Amazon reviews** → is there social proof and product-market fit?

---

## 🧩 Step 5: Find Product Angles

Exploding Topics isn’t just for products — sometimes you’ll spot **micro-trends**:

* Example: “Home office lighting” or “RGB gaming setups.”
* That signals **angles** you can use in marketing (e.g., “Transform your gaming setup with smart lights”).

✅ So in short: **Exploding Topics → Idea spark → Validate with Google Trends + Ads Library → Check competition + supply.**
